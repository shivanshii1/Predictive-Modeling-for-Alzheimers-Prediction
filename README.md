# Predictive-Modeling-for-Alzheimers-Prediction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that progressively damages brain cells, resulting in memory and thinking deficits, loss of basic abilities, and ultimately, death.
While there is no cure for AD, its onset diagnosis can prevent it from becoming too severe thus improving patientâ€™s life.
This project aims to classify individuals in the category of mild dementia, moderate dementia, no dementia, and very mild dementia.
Future prospects of this project include early detection and intervention.
